## About

---

I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the [UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in NLP](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/natural-language-processing) (The University of Edinburgh), where I am working on cross-domain explainable abuse detection under the supervision of [Bj√∂rn Ross](https://sweb.inf.ed.ac.uk/bross3/) and [Mirella Lapata](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/). I am a member of the [EdinburghNLP](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/) group based at the [Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) (ILCC).


I have worked as a Research Intern in the Assistant AI team at Meta Reality Labs.


Previously I was a Research Fellow at [Sapienza NLP](http://nlp.uniroma1.it/) (Sapienza University of Rome), where I worked on multimodal systems for language-vision tasks, and at the development of [BabelPic](https://sapienzanlp.github.io/babelpic/).
