## About

---

I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the [UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in NLP](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/natural-language-processing) (The University of Edinburgh), where I am working on cross-domain explainable abuse detection under the supervision of Bj√∂rn Ross.


Previously I was a Research Fellow at Sapienza NLP (Sapienza University of Rome), where I worked on multimodal systems for language-vision tasks and at the development of [BabelPic](https://sapienzanlp.github.io/babelpic/).
