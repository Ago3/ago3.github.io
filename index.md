## About

---

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the [UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in NLP](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/natural-language-processing) (The University of Edinburgh), where I am working on policy-aware explainable abuse detection under the supervision of [Bj√∂rn Ross](https://sweb.inf.ed.ac.uk/bross3/) and [Mirella Lapata](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/). I am a member of the [EdinburghNLP](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/) group based at the [Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) (ILCC).


I have worked as a Research Intern in the Computational Social Science team at Snap Inc. (Fall 2023) and in the Assistant AI team at Meta Reality Labs (Fall 2022).


Previously I was a Research Fellow at [Sapienza NLP](http://nlp.uniroma1.it/) (Sapienza University of Rome), where I worked on multimodal systems for language-vision tasks, and at the development of [BabelPic](https://sapienzanlp.github.io/babelpic/).

**I am currently on the job market, looking for Research Scientist roles in NLP, ideally with a focus on safety.**
